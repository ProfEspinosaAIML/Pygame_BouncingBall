# Pygame Bouncing Ball Simulation

### A Programming Journey with AI: From Concept to Code

This project began with a single request to create a Python program of a ball bouncing within a spinning hexagon. The initial prompt provided the core concept, including physics requirements like gravity and friction, and the need for realistic collision detection. The AI, acting as a coding partner, took this high-level idea and broke it down into manageable steps: setting up the environment, implementing physics, handling rotation, and drawing the graphics using the Pygame library. Subsequent interactions addressed a common Git and GitHub workflow issue, providing step-by-step solutions to synchronize local and remote repositories. This collaborative process transformed a basic idea into a complete, documented, and version-controlled project.

### Improved Prompt for Better Results

Instead of a high-level request, a more detailed and structured prompt would have produced a better initial response, leading to faster and more accurate code generation.

**Proposed Prompt:**

"Write a Python program using the Pygame library to simulate a ball bouncing inside a spinning hexagon. The simulation must include the following features:

* **Ball Physics:** The ball should be affected by gravity and have a velocity that decreases over time due to friction.
* **Collision Detection:** Implement a physics-based collision system where the ball bounces off the hexagon's walls realistically, including a coefficient of restitution to simulate energy loss.
* **Hexagon Properties:** The hexagon should be a closed, six-sided polygon that rotates continuously around its center. The rotation speed should be a configurable parameter.
* **Code Structure:** Organize the code into separate classes for the `Ball` and the `Hexagon`. Include clear comments and documentation for all key functions and variables.
* **Implementation:** Provide the complete, runnable Python code, and include instructions on how to set up the Pygame environment and run the script."

These were the steps taken to start the project in GitHub and to synchronize the local project folder.

| Step | Git Command and Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Create the GitHub Repository** | **Log into your GitHub account.** In the top right corner, click the **+** sign and select **New repository**. <br> **Name the repository** "Pygame_BouncingBall". <br> **Set the visibility** to "Public". <br> **Check the box** to "Add a README file". This creates the initial commit on the remote repository and is the reason we need the `--allow-unrelated-histories` flag later. Finally, click **Create repository**. |
| **2. Initialize Git in your project** | `git init`<br>This command creates a new, empty Git repository in your local project folder. It's the first step in tracking your project's changes. |
| **3. Link local and remote repositories** | `git remote add origin https://github.com/ProfEspinosaAIML/Pygame_BouncingBall.git`<br>This command establishes the connection between your local repository and your GitHub repository. The name **origin** is a standard alias for the remote URL. |
| **4. Pull the remote files (including `README.md`)** | `git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories`<br>This is the critical step that resolves the "unrelated histories" error. It forces a merge between your local and remote branches, allowing your local repository to receive the `README.md` file you created on GitHub. You only need to use the `--allow-unrelated-histories` flag once when connecting two previously separate repositories. |
| **5. Add files to the staging area** | `git add .`<br>This command adds all your new and modified files (in this case, `bouncing_ball.py`) to the staging area, preparing them for the next commit. |
| **6. Commit the changes** | `git commit -m "Add initial bouncing_ball.py script"`<br>This command saves the staged changes to your local repository. The `-m` flag allows you to include a message describing the commit. |
| **7. Push the code to GitHub** | `git push -u origin main`<br>This command uploads your committed changes to the remote repository. The `-u` flag is used the first time to set up the connection, allowing you to use `git push` and `git pull` without extra arguments in the future. |
| **8. Modify the `README.md` file** | *This is not a Git command.*<br>Open the `README.md` file in Visual Studio Code and make your desired changes, like adding a project description or usage instructions. |
| **9. Add and commit the new changes** | `git add README.md`<br>`git commit -m "Update README.md with project description"`<br>These commands stage and save the changes you made to the `README.md` file. |
| **10. Push the final changes** | `git push`<br>This command uploads your final commit with the modified `README.md` file to your GitHub repository. |
